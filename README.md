Installation
-------------

Download the repository and compile it on order to download all required NuGet packages. If you dont have automatic NuGet package restore enabled in Visual Studio then it will have to be enabled.

Open Web.config and enter your TeamCity server information into the appSettings labeled teamcity_username, teamcity_password and teamcity_api_url.

In the constructor of HomeController.cs, you can switch between using DefaultBuildMonitorModelHandler (shows all jobs in TeamCity automatically) or the CustomBuildMonitorModelHandler which allows you to customize what to display. You can customize your personal view by editing the file App_Data/Settings.xml.
